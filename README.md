my second internship project code at codsoft

This is a e commerce landing pages website
I am excited to share with you my second task project at CodSoft, a ReactJS e-commerce landing page. Through this project, I learned about:

Responsive design: how to create a website that looks and functions well on all devices, from desktop computers to smartphones.
Color combination: how to choose complementary colors that create a visually appealing and cohesive design.
ReactJS: a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
